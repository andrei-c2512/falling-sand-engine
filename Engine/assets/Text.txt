class Element {
	- has the data necessary to represent a particle in a falling sand engine: color, type 
	and other stuff necessary for special behaviour of some particles
	- the data necessary for special behaviour has issues. Each element doesn't have to have rng stuff. Only the one that
	tries to modify it, should. 
	- it also has the configuration of all element types
